> The best way to eliminate those bad feelings is to just think the tasks **as they really are** and **preparing for failure**

The story began with a fluent and sophisticated TOEFL speaking answer. But unfortunately, it's not made by me. It is an answer made by a girl in the same *TOEFL speaking practice group* with me. 

She amazed me by her quick and content-rich speaking. 

I suddenly felt like, how can she be that great and how can I be better at speaking?

The fact is that, my speaking English is featured by nearly perfect pronunciation and terrible sentence-constructing. 

And I thought my key problem is that,

- lacking familiarity with those words
- slow speed to construct a sentense

But they are all not a big deal when I'm writing, because I have enough time to choose the proper word and the proper sentence structure.

So I think it's high time for me to get more inputs and more importantly, **much more outputs**.

Therefore, I searched for the *Good ways to practice TOEFL speaking*, and I found *__italki__*, which was recommended a lot.

**And my journey on italki just started!**

I want to say, so far, it's AMAZING.

I found a cool American man who is quite friendly, wise and humorous. He taught me a lot.

I was nervous and exited at that time. He just took himself as an example and told me that the best way to eliminate this bad feeling is to just think the tasks **as they really are** and **always preparing for failure**. 100% wisdom, I respect him for that.

And then he patiently corrected my subtle pronunciation in a quite comfortable way.

He's a really good guy. I didn't expect to really have a friend there, especially such a nice one. But it just happed and I'm so lucky.

What's more, I also booked a half-hour trial lesson of a carefully picked Professional English teacher. I'll update this after the lesson.
