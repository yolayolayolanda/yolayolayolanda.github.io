I disappeared for about one month. During most of these period time, I was running around in circles for my application for graduate application. 

I'm going to apply for universities in America next semester and I'm now lack of research experiences. So in early March, I tried to seek for a summer research opportunity. 

I know it won't be a piece of cake, but I didn't expect it to be quite a painful memory. I sent about 60 letters. Just like stones dropped into the sea, most of them received nothing. But to my relief, finally I got a few positive responses. After some short interviews, I got 4 offers and chose the one that I thought would be the most appropriate for my research direction. 

I was happy to have this opportunity and I thought everything was promising, although the professor always replied after about one week. I started to prepare for the  J1 visa application immediately as the professor told me that he thought it's the visa type I should apply for. However, after my preparations for all the documents required by DS-2019, I was told that the university won't allow undergraduates to get DS-2019 and apply for J1 visa to there. "Ok, how about B1/B2?", I thought there was an alternative. It has already been very popular for applicators like me seeking for self-funded research opportunities with B visa. So I sent an email talked about this alternative with the professor and he insisted that I ask IES for sanction. 

You know, most departments won't give positive responses on issues like that. So I had already become hopeless at that time. To my surprise, they did replied me with positive response. It is not hard to understand my feeling, I was so excited and told the good news to the professor immediately. Another long week came and day after day, I became more and more worried about the attitude of the professor. Finally, he replied the email with "Sorry for that". He is not willing to take the risk of that and **my application for US universities is over!**

ü§™Just kidding. 

**How can it be possible for me to just quit because of a setback like that! I mean, come on, I have prepared so much for that.** 

So I tried to contact the professor I rejected before. Fortunately, he said I was still welcome. What a glimmer of hope for me! BUT several days later, he told me that "I thought our research direction is not appropriate for you".

To be honest, I really suffered from the hopeless waiting and unpredictable responses. 

**But that is life and you have no one to blame.** 

Whatever, I'm still here and trying my best to struggle for my future. Just like you.

Waiting for our good newsüòÅ
